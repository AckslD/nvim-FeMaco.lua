:exclamation: Originally this was written for only markdown code blocks.
However this plugin now support any language injection in any language!

Catalyze your **Fe**nced **Ma**rkdown **Co**de-block editing!

(based on this
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FeMoco#/media/File:FeMoco_cluster.svg>)

A small plugin allowing to edit injected language trees with correct filetype
in a floating window. This allows you to use all of your config for your
favorite language. The buffer will be also linked to a temporary file in order
to allow LSPs to work properly.

Powered by treesitter, lua and coffee.

INSTALLATION                                      *FeMaco-femaco-installation*

For example using `packer` <https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim>:

>lua
    use {
      'AckslD/nvim-FeMaco.lua',
      config = 'require("femaco").setup()',
    }
<

Requires `nvim-treesitter`
<https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter>.


CONFIGURATION                                    *FeMaco-femaco-configuration*

Pass a dictionary into `require("femaco").setup()` with callback functions.
These are the defaults:

>lua
    require('femaco').setup({
      -- should prepare a new buffer and return the winid
      -- by default opens a floating window
      -- provide a different callback to change this behaviour
      -- @param opts: the return value from float_opts
      prepare_buffer = function(opts)
        local buf = vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, false)
        return vim.api.nvim_open_win(buf, true, opts)
      end,
      -- should return options passed to nvim_open_win
      -- @param code_block: data about the code-block with the keys
      --   * range
      --   * lines
      --   * lang
      float_opts = function(code_block)
        return {
          relative = 'cursor',
          width = clip_val(5, 120, vim.api.nvim_win_get_width(0) - 10),  -- TODO how to offset sign column etc?
          height = clip_val(5, #code_block.lines, vim.api.nvim_win_get_height(0) - 6),
          anchor = 'NW',
          row = 0,
          col = 0,
          style = 'minimal',
          border = 'rounded',
          zindex = 1,
        }
      end,
      -- return filetype to use for a given lang
      -- lang can be nil
      ft_from_lang = function(lang)
        return lang
      end,
      -- what to do after opening the float
      post_open_float = function(winnr)
        vim.wo.signcolumn = 'no'
      end
      -- create the path to a temporary file
      create_tmp_filepath = function(filetype)
        return os.tmpname()
      end,
      -- if a newline should always be used, useful for multiline injections
      -- which separators needs to be on separate lines such as markdown, neorg etc
      -- @param base_filetype: The filetype which FeMaco is called from, not the
      -- filetype of the injected language (this is the current buffer so you can
      -- get it from vim.bo.filetyp).
      ensure_newline = function(base_filetype)
        return false
      end,
      -- Return true if the indentation should be normalized. Useful when the
      -- injected language inherits indentation from the construction scope (e.g. an
      -- inline multiline sql string). If true, the leading indentation is detected,
      -- stripped, and restored before/after editing.
      --
      -- @param base_filetype: The filetype which FeMaco is called from, not the
      -- filetype of the injected language (this is the current buffer, so you can
      -- get it from vim.bo.filetype).
      normalize_indent = function (base_filetype)
        return false
      end
    })

USAGE                                                    *FeMaco-femaco-usage*

Call `:FeMaco` or `require('femaco.edit').edit_code_block()` with your cursor
on a code-block. Edit the content, then save and/or close the popup to update
the original buffer.
